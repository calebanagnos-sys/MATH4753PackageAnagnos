The probability of an event, \(A\), is defined as the probability that at least 2 people having the same birthday when the class size is \(n\).

This can be represented as:

\[P(A^C)=\frac{365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^n}\]

Which means that:
 \(P(A)\)
 
can be calculated as:

\[P(A)=1-P(A^C)\]
